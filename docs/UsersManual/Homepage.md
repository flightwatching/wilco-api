#Navigating From the Homepage

The first thing you see when you open wilco is a page that looks like this:

##Timelines
Timelines describe the activities of each plane over time, and allow you to access the reports with data from each plane.  There are several methods of selecting which plane's timeline you wish to see.  

* One way is to go to ops, which will look like this:

   Click on the plane you want to monitor (represented by an airplane in the diagram), and its timeline will come up.  You can click and drag to move the view around, and scroll to zoom.

* Another way is to click on MCC, or Maintenance control center, which will look like this:

   All of the plane will be listed; click on one to bring up its timeline.  

* Alternatively, you can go to ENG:

   The planes will all be listed there, planes with alerts in a section above those without.  Once again, click on a any plane to bring up its timeline.
