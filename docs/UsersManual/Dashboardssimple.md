Dashboards simple


Dashboards
At the timeline, you can click on a report (acms) to make a dashboard come up.  The dashboard contains a multitude of information about the plane's systems.  

Clicking on any of the various gauges or labels will bring up a chart with the history of that data point; other inputs can be plotted against each other in the chart by clicking off of the chart back onto the main page, then clicking on the second data point.  A curve can be removed by clicking on the name of the unwanted curve in the bottom left of the chart window (below the actual chart).  

There are two types of trend charts: there is the default chart, which is simpler, and more automatic, and then there user customizable chart, which is more dynamic and is customizable, allowing the user to define which curves he or she wishes to include, as well as letting the user display several plots near each other; because of this, it is useful for plotting a data point in a general context.  

For example, this is the default curve for two data points:

And this is a user customizable chart containing the data point (Transfered Pressure) as well as some context (Engine Number 1):
